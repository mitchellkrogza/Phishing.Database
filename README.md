## Purpose of this repo?

This is just one of a number of extensive projects dealing with testing the status of harmful domain names and web sites. We test sources of Phishing attacks to keep track of how many of the domain names used in Phishing attacks are still active and functioning. We sort all domains from all sources into one list, removing any duplicates so that we have a clean list of domains to work with.

************************************************
## How do you test?

We make use of the awesome [PyFunceble Testing Suite](https://github.com/funilrys/PyFunceble) written by [Nissar Chababy](https://github.com/funilrys/). Over 2 years in development this testing tool really provides us with a reliable source of active and inactive domains and through regular testing even domains which are inactive and may become active again are automatically moved back to the active list.

************************************************
## Contributing

If you have a source list of phishing domains why not contribute them to this project for testing? Simply send a PR adding your input source details and we will add the source.
